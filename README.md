# Doing journalism with gender pay gap data

This repo contains tips for finding stories in data on gender pay.

First, [download the gender pay gap data from the Gender Pay Gap Service here](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download). You should see partial data for the current year (with a smaller number of employers than the others), and full data for past years.

Download the most recent *full* year of data.

Then open the data in Excel or Google Sheets.
